VoIP Model Traffic Shaping
==========================

- Measures the time difference (normalized according to ~/.socialsdn/timediffs/)
and reports statistics on network delay.

- Measures data rate of outbound network traffic to detect side-channel information leaks.

- Pads outbound packets to be 1610 bytes in length, thus preventing side-channel information leakage.
